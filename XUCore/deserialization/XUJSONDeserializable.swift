	/// This method is called when the deserializer encounters a dictionary under

	/// @note - If the returned object is not conforming to XUJSONDeserializable,
	/// the deserializer stops there, otherwise it keeps deserializing
	/// the dictionary into the returned object.
	///
	/// - the deserializer calls this method even if an array of objects is
	/// stored under this key. In such case, this method is called n-times,
	/// where n is the number of items in the array.
	///
	/// - if nil is returned, the object is given another chance in
	/// performCustomDeserialization* methods.
