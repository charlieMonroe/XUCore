	///  - if there is only one screen (or none) available, that one is returned
	///  - if there are more screens and there's a key window, the screen of that window is used
	///  - if there is no key window, main window is used
	///  - if there is no key and no main window, then we use the mouse location on screen
	///  - if that doesn't help, we try to use NSApp.orderedWindows
	///  - we give up and return NSScreen.main or the first screen.
